NODE.JS & EXPRESS RULES
- Use async/await everywhere
- Never place business logic in controllers
- Controllers must only:
  - Validate input
  - Call application services
  - Map responses
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, rate limiting)
- Use DTOs for input/output boundaries
- Use environment-based configuration
- Apply API versioning
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Ensure graceful shutdown and resource cleanup


This project:
- Uses Node.js + TypeScript + Express
- Follows Clean Architecture + DDD
- Uses feature-based folder structure
- Controllers must be thin
- Business logic lives in the domain layer
- Uses PostgreSQL with Prisma
- Uses JWT authentication
- API is versioned (/api/v1)
- Uses rate limiting and request validation
